  abstract        = {Structural analyses are an integral part of computational
                  research on nucleation and supercooled water, whose accuracy
                  and efficiency can impact the validity and feasibility of such
                  studies. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these often
                  elusive and computationally expensive processes can be
                  inferred from the evolution of ice-like structures, determined
                  using appropriate structural analysis techniques. We present
                  d-SEAMS, a free and open-source post-processing engine for the
                  analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories, which is
                  specifically able to qualitatively classify ice structures, in
                  both strong confinement and bulk systems. For the first time,
                  recent algorithms for confined ice structure determination
                  have been implemented, along with topological network criteria
                  for bulk ice structure determination. We also propose and
                  validate a new order parameter for identifying the building
                  blocks of quasi-two-dimensional ice. Recognizing the need for
                  customization in structural analysis, d-SEAMS has a unique
                  code architecture, built with nix, employing a YAML-Lua
                  scripting pipeline. The software has been designed to be
                  user-friendly and extensible. The engine outputs are
                  compatible with popular graphics software suites, allowing for
                  immediate visual insights into the systems studied. We
                  demonstrate the features of d-SEAMS by using it to analyze
                  nucleation in the bulk regime and for quasi-one and
                  quasi-two-dimensional systems. Structural time evolution and
                  quantitative metrics are determined for heterogenous ice
                  nucleation on a silver-exposed b-AgI surface, homogenous ice
                  nucleation, flat monolayer square ice formation and freezing

  abstract = {One of the most ubiquitous and technologically important phenomena in nature is the nucleation of homogeneous flowing systems. The microscopic effects of shear on a nucleating system are still imperfectly understood, although in recent years a consistent picture has emerged. The opposing effects of shear can be split into two major contributions for simple atomic and molecular liquids: increase of the energetic cost of nucleation, and enhancement of the kinetics. In this perspective, we describe the latest computational and theoretical techniques which have been developed over the past two decades. We collate and unify the overarching influences of shear, temperature, and supersaturation on the process of homogeneous nucleation. Experimental techniques and capabilities are discussed, against the backdrop of results from simulations and theory. Although we primarily focus on simple systems, we also touch upon the sheared nucleation of more complex systems, including glasses and polymer melts. We speculate on the promising directions and possible advances that could come to fruition in the future.},

We construct the compression-limit phase diagram for several slit widths over a wide range of gigapascal-high lateral pressures. We observe the assembly of solid-like amorphous monolayer, bilayer, and trilayer phases, distinct from the ordered structures found in both pure bulk water and quasi-two-dimensional confined water. The underlying mechanism of dehydration, caused by the disruptive presence of ions, and the concomitant destruction of the long-range order of the encapsulating water hydrogen-bond network are critically analyzed. Orientational analyses of the constrained salt-water system reveal ties to interlayer water hydrogen bonding and the preferential arrangement of ion and water layers. Our results offer fresh insight into the formation and structural characteristics of the phases exhibited by nanoconfined salt water.}

Confined systems are characterized by a plethora of diverse ordered structures and interesting hydrogen-bond-networks (HBNs), distinct from those formed in the bulk. Our methodology has no a-priori assumptions, and can be used as an exploratory tool for probing confined ice structures. In our recipe, primitive rings are identified, and further, only connections corresponding to hydrogen bonds are permitted. The prism identification scheme developed identifies prismatic units, which are the building blocks of ice nanotubes (INTs). In addition, we formulate novel and intuitive order parameters based on our topological network criteria, which are able to qualitatively and accurately describe phase transitions.We have subsumed this methodology into a framework developed for the analysis of Molecular Simulations. The software framework is powered by our FOSS engine, d-SEAMS (deferred Structural Elucidation Analysis of Molecular Simulations). The ability to extend trivially, with best practices, our software is demonstrated by our ability to rapidly implement algorithms, like the graph theoretical structure families above. Our engine is intuitive to work with and abstracts away from the user much of the repetitive tooling which is part of every molecular simulation analysis to allow the researcher to focus on results. Among other features, d-SEAMS is able to classify ice structures across all scales, from nanoscale confinement to bulk. d-SEAMS has a unique work-flow, designed to be simultaneously customizable and easy-to-use. d-SEAMS is built reproducibly with nix, using deterministic cryptographic hashes for the dependency build graph. Lua-scripting and YAML inputs enable users to specify pre-defined work-flows and variables respectively. The outputs produced by d-SEAMS are consumable by popular graphics software suites, for immediate visual insights into the systems studied.},
