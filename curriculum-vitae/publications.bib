                  Drawing inspiration from qualitative visual inspection{,} we

                  ordered structures of confined water{,} using a graph
                  theoretic approach. Our criterion is based on primitive
                  rings{,} and reinterprets the hydrogen-bond-network in terms
                  of these primitives. This approach has no a priori
                  assumptions{,} except the hydrogen bond definition{,} and may
                  be used as an exploratory tool for the automated discovery of
                  new ordered phases. We demonstrate the versatility of our
                  criterion by applying it to analyse well-known monolayer ices.
                  Our methodology is then extended to identify the building

  abstract        = {Structural analyses are an integral part of computational
                  research on nucleation and supercooled water, whose accuracy
                  and efficiency can impact the validity and feasibility of such
                  studies. The underlying molecular mechanisms of these often
                  elusive and computationally expensive processes can be
                  inferred from the evolution of ice-like structures, determined
                  using appropriate structural analysis techniques. We present
                  d-SEAMS, a free and open-source post-processing engine for the
                  analysis of molecular dynamics trajectories, which is
                  specifically able to qualitatively classify ice structures, in
                  both strong confinement and bulk systems. For the first time,
                  recent algorithms for confined ice structure determination
                  have been implemented, along with topological network criteria
                  for bulk ice structure determination. We also propose and
                  validate a new order parameter for identifying the building
                  blocks of quasi-two-dimensional ice. Recognizing the need for
                  customization in structural analysis, d-SEAMS has a unique
                  code architecture, built with nix, employing a YAML-Lua
                  scripting pipeline. The software has been designed to be
                  user-friendly and extensible. The engine outputs are
                  compatible with popular graphics software suites, allowing for
                  immediate visual insights into the systems studied. We
                  demonstrate the features of d-SEAMS by using it to analyze
                  nucleation in the bulk regime and for quasi-one and
                  quasi-two-dimensional systems. Structural time evolution and
                  quantitative metrics are determined for heterogenous ice
                  nucleation on a silver-exposed b-AgI surface, homogenous ice
                  nucleation, flat monolayer square ice formation and freezing

  abstract        = {We present a family of general topological criteria, for the determination of structures of quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional ices. Confined systems are characterized by a plethora of diverse ordered structures and interesting hydrogen-bond-networks (HBNs), distinct from those formed in the bulk. Our methodology has no a-priori assumptions, and can be used as an exploratory tool for probing confined ice structures. In our recipe, primitive rings are identified, and further, only connections corresponding to hydrogen bonds are permitted. The prism identification scheme developed identifies prismatic units, which are the building blocks of ice nanotubes (INTs). In addition, we formulate novel and intuitive order parameters based on our topological network criteria, which are able to qualitatively and accurately describe phase transitions.We have subsumed this methodology into a framework developed for the analysis of Molecular Simulations. The software framework is powered by our FOSS engine, d-SEAMS (deferred Structural Elucidation Analysis of Molecular Simulations). The ability to extend trivially, with best practices, our software is demonstrated by our ability to rapidly implement algorithms, like the graph theoretical structure families above. Our engine is intuitive to work with and abstracts away from the user much of the repetitive tooling which is part of every molecular simulation analysis to allow the researcher to focus on results. Among other features, d-SEAMS is able to classify ice structures across all scales, from nanoscale confinement to bulk. d-SEAMS has a unique work-flow, designed to be simultaneously customizable and easy-to-use. d-SEAMS is built reproducibly with nix, using deterministic cryptographic hashes for the dependency build graph. Lua-scripting and YAML inputs enable users to specify pre-defined work-flows and variables respectively. The outputs produced by d-SEAMS are consumable by popular graphics software suites, for immediate visual insights into the systems studied.},
